 * A Enter hit doesn't get recognized as correct. Also it starts with &. What happens currently if the current character is coincidently & too?
 *
 * There should at least three characters displayed not only the enter symbol or two more. At least three 'normal' characters
 *
 * Change Prettier settings. I don't like when the array gets formatted like this, see below
 *
 * Highlight the current character. Maybe give the current character a bigger font size
 *
 * Use different font-family, what is the difference?
