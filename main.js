/** * Todo
 *
 * Version 11
 * 
 * Include transition: I think I need to use translateX instead of left = ...
 *
 * A Enter hit doesn't get recognized as correct. Also it starts with &. What happens currently if the current character is coincidently & too?
 *
 * There should at least three characters displayed not only the enter symbol or two more. At least three 'normal' characters
 *
 * Setup Git so that I have a file control system. With this I can make tags.
 *
 * Change Prettier settings. I don't like when the array gets formatted like this, see below
 *
 * Highlight the current character. Maybe give the current character a bigger font size
 *
 * Use different font-family, what is the difference?
 * 
 * Ich glaube beim Verschieben ist das '/ 2' ein Problem, da sich das h√§uft und dadurch zu weit nach rechts driftet
